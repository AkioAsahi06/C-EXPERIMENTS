# C-EXPERIMENTS
1. Write programs to print statements in sequential order using simple printf, scanf input/output
functions.
2. Write programs to implement if-else condition (simple as well as nested) on suitable problems.
3. Write a program to implement switch-case conditional logic on suitable examples.
4. Write programs to implement for, while and do-while loop control statements on suitable problems.
5. Write programs to implement 1D & 2D array concepts on suitable problems such as sorting of
elements, searching of element, matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.
6. Write programs to implement string related concepts such as sorting of a string, finding its length,
reversing, concatenation, comparing two strings etc.
7. Write programs to implement concept of user defined functions (call by value, call by reference,
recursive calling etc.) on suitable examples.
8. Write programs to implement concepts of pointer.
9. Write programs to implement the concept of structure and union.
10. Write programs to implement dynamic memory allocation functions (calloc, malloc, free, realloc)
11. Write programs to implement file handling concepts such as reading from a file, writing to a file
using file related functions (fclose, fopen, sscanf, sprint, fread, fwrite, getc, putc, getw, putw etc.)
